Garry's Mod World Portals
=============

World portals inspired by Overv's Portal Project and Portal 2's linked_portal_door.


## Project Status

This project hasn't been in development since the summer of 2014.
It was mainly abandoned due to the lack of support for manipulating visibility leafs in gmod.
This requires maps that use it to disable visibility optimization, which can significantly
slow down large maps.


### Code Status

* Rendering: almost complete
* Weapon and trace diversion: just started
* Entity teleportation: just started
